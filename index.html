<h1>Matilda Cast Guide: cast of Matilda across film and stage</h1>
</header>
<section id="intro" class="content-section">
<h2>What this Matilda cast site covers</h2>
<p>The <strong>Matilda cast</strong> encompasses a diverse range of performers who have brought Roald Dahl's beloved characters to life across multiple formats and decades. This international reference guide covers <strong>matilda movie cast members</strong>, <strong>matilda film actors</strong>, <strong>matilda stage cast</strong>, <strong>matilda musical performers</strong>, <strong>matilda voice actors</strong>, and the broader <strong>matilda cast and crew</strong> who contribute to each production. For fans looking for entertainment, the <a href="https://wildrobin1.ca/">Wild Robin Casino Promo Code</a> can enhance your experience. Understanding the scope of Matilda casting requires recognising that several distinct productions exist: the 1996 film directed by Danny DeVito, the Royal Shakespeare Company stage musical that premiered in 2010, subsequent touring productions worldwide, and the 2022 film adaptation of the musical released by Netflix and Sony Pictures.</p>
<p>Each production features its own unique <strong>cast of Matilda</strong>, with credits that vary significantly by region, year, and performance venue. The 1996 film offers a fixed cast list documented in official studio credits, while stage productions rotate performers regularly, with <strong>matilda ensemble cast</strong> members, understudies, and alternates changing throughout a run. International touring companies further complicate the landscape, as <strong>matilda character actors</strong> differ between West End, Broadway, Australian, and regional productions. This guide provides a framework for understanding how <strong>matilda actors names</strong> are verified, how <strong>matilda actor roles</strong> are documented, and where to find reliable information about the <strong>matilda theatrical cast</strong> for specific performances.</p>
<p>Our objective is to serve as a neutral, news-style reference that helps researchers, theatre enthusiasts, and fans navigate the complex world of Matilda casting. We prioritise official credits, theatre programmes, and reputable sources such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_(1996_film)" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia's coverage of the 1996 Matilda film</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_the_Musical" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">documentation of Matilda the Musical</a>, and authoritative references like <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Roald-Dahl" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Britannica's Roald Dahl biography</a>. Additional context can be found through major cultural institutions such as <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">the British Film Institute</a>, which archives film credits and production histories.</p>
<p>Whether you are seeking information about <strong>matilda production cast</strong> for a specific tour date, researching the original film's performers, or comparing how roles have been interpreted across different media, this site offers structured guidance. For answers to common questions, visit our <a href="/faq">Matilda Cast FAQ</a>. To understand our verification methods and editorial standards, please see our <a href="/about-us">About Matilda Cast</a> page. We aim to maintain accuracy while acknowledging that casting is a dynamic process, particularly in live theatre, where the <strong>matilda cast list</strong> can change from performance to performance.</p>

<h2>Navigate by production type</h2>
<p>To use this site effectively, it helps to understand the distinction between different types of Matilda productions. Film actors are documented in fixed credits that do not change after release, while theatrical cast members rotate regularly. The <strong>matilda cast and crew</strong> for a touring production will differ from the original West End or Broadway companies, and regional productions may feature entirely different ensembles.</p>
<nav aria-label="Production type navigation">
<ul class="production-nav">
<li><strong>Film productions:</strong> Refer to official studio credits and end-credit sequences for definitive <strong>matilda film actors</strong> and <strong>matilda movie cast members</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Stage and musical productions:</strong> Consult theatre programmes for the specific performance date to identify the <strong>matilda stage cast</strong> and <strong>matilda musical performers</strong> on that occasion.</li>
<li><strong>Ensemble and supporting roles:</strong> The <strong>matilda ensemble cast</strong> and understudies are often listed separately in programmes and may vary by performance.</li>
<li><strong>Voice and dubbing:</strong> For productions with voice performance, check official credits to identify <strong>matilda voice actors</strong> separately from on-screen talent.</li>
</ul>
</nav>
<aside class="note-box">
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Always verify credits against official sources for the exact production and date you are researching. Casting can change due to scheduling, illness, or contractual arrangements.</p>

<h2>Cast list framework: roles, performer types, and credit notes</h2>
<p>Rather than attempting to provide a single definitive <strong>matilda cast list</strong>—which would be impossible given the number of productions and constant rotation of performers—this site offers a framework for understanding how <strong>matilda actor roles</strong> are tracked and verified. The table below illustrates the key dimensions of Matilda casting: the character or role label, the production format in which that role appears, the category of performer (lead, supporting, ensemble, understudy, or voice), and the type of credit source that should be consulted for verification.</p>
<p>This framework applies across all Matilda productions, whether you are researching <strong>matilda character actors</strong> from the 1996 film, identifying <strong>matilda musical performers</strong> from a recent West End performance, or tracing the <strong>matilda production cast</strong> for an international tour. By understanding these categories, you can more effectively locate and verify <strong>matilda actors names</strong> and ensure that your research reflects accurate, source-backed information.</p>

<p>The table above serves as a reference model. For the 1996 film, the <strong>cast of Matilda</strong> is fixed and can be verified through studio releases and the film's end credits. For stage productions, however, the <strong>matilda theatrical cast</strong> is fluid, with multiple actors often sharing the title role on alternating performances, and ensemble members rotating throughout a run. When researching a specific performance, always consult the programme issued for that date and venue, as it will list the <strong>matilda stage cast</strong> who actually performed.</p>
<p>Understanding performer categories is also essential. Lead roles such as Matilda and Miss Honey are typically credited prominently, while supporting and ensemble roles may be listed collectively. Understudies and alternates are often noted separately, and in some productions, multiple child actors share the title role on a rotating schedule. For voice work, particularly in dubbed versions or animated adaptations, <strong>matilda voice actors</strong> should be verified through official studio documentation, as voice credits are sometimes omitted from promotional materials.</p>

<h2>How we verify Matilda actors names and credits</h2>
<p>Accurate documentation of the <strong>matilda cast</strong> requires a rigorous verification workflow. We prioritise official credits as the primary source: for films, this means studio-issued cast lists and end-credit sequences; for stage productions, this means theatre programmes distributed at the specific performance. Secondary sources include reputable press coverage from established news outlets, reference works such as encyclopedias and film archives, and official announcements from production companies and theatre organisations.</p>
<p>Regional casting changes are common, particularly for touring productions of the musical. A <strong>matilda production cast</strong> in London may differ entirely from the cast performing in Sydney, New York, or regional UK venues on the same dates. Similarly, the <strong>matilda ensemble cast</strong> for a national tour will rotate as the production moves between cities, with local performers sometimes joining the company for specific legs of the tour. We note these variations where possible and encourage users to verify <strong>matilda actors names</strong> against the programme or official credits for the exact performance they are researching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Verification policy:</strong> All cast information on this site is cross-referenced against official credits, theatre programmes, and reputable secondary sources. Where conflicting information exists, we note the discrepancy and indicate which sources support each version. This is a reference guide, not an authoritative database, and users are encouraged to consult primary sources for definitive confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This approach ensures that our coverage of <strong>matilda film actors</strong>, <strong>matilda musical performers</strong>, and <strong>matilda character actors</strong> remains as accurate and transparent as possible, while acknowledging the inherent complexity of tracking a cast that spans multiple productions, formats, and decades.</p>
