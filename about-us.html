<h1>About Matilda Cast: how we track the cast of Matilda</h1>
</header>
<section id="mission" class="content-section">
<h2>Our purpose</h2>
<p>Matilda Cast exists to provide an international reference for the <strong>matilda cast</strong>, <strong>matilda cast list</strong>, and <strong>matilda actors names</strong> across multiple productions, formats, and decades. Our mission is to serve researchers, theatre enthusiasts, educators, and fans with objective, well-sourced information about <strong>matilda film actors</strong>, <strong>matilda musical performers</strong>, <strong>matilda stage cast</strong> members, and the broader <strong>matilda cast and crew</strong> who have contributed to bringing Roald Dahl's beloved story to life.</p>
<p>We recognise that Matilda casting is complex and dynamic. The 1996 film offers a fixed <strong>cast of Matilda</strong> documented in studio credits, while stage productions feature rotating performers, understudies, and ensemble members whose participation varies by date, venue, and region. International touring companies, regional productions, and the 2022 film adaptation of the musical add further layers of complexity. Our goal is not to provide a single definitive cast list—an impossible task given the scope and fluidity of Matilda productions—but rather to offer a structured framework for understanding how <strong>matilda character actors</strong> are documented, verified, and researched.</p>
<p>We maintain a news-style, objective editorial tone, prioritising accuracy, transparency, and source attribution. This site is a reference guide, not an authoritative database, and we encourage users to consult primary sources such as official credits, theatre programmes, and reputable press coverage for definitive confirmation of <strong>matilda actor roles</strong> and <strong>matilda production cast</strong> information.</p>
</section>
<section id="method" class="content-section">
<h2>Editorial method for matilda cast and crew references</h2>
<p>Our editorial method is grounded in a clear sourcing hierarchy. We prioritise official credits as the primary source: for films, this means studio-issued cast lists, end-credit sequences, and official press materials; for stage productions, this means theatre programmes distributed at specific performances, official announcements from production companies, and verified casting notices. Secondary sources include reputable press coverage from established news outlets such as <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">the BBC</a> and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">The Guardian</a>, as well as reference works like <a href="https://www.britannica.com/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Britannica</a> and archival resources from cultural institutions.</p>
<p>When conflicting information exists—such as discrepancies between a theatre programme and press coverage, or variations in <strong>matilda ensemble cast</strong> listings across different sources—we note the conflict and indicate which sources support each version. We do not attempt to resolve disputes definitively but instead provide users with the information needed to make their own informed judgements. This approach reflects the reality that casting documentation, particularly for stage productions, can be incomplete, inconsistent, or subject to last-minute changes due to illness, scheduling conflicts, or contractual arrangements.</p>
<p>Regional theatre listings present particular challenges. A <strong>matilda production cast</strong> in London may differ entirely from the cast performing in Sydney, New York, or regional UK venues on the same dates. Touring productions rotate performers as they move between cities, and local actors sometimes join the company for specific legs of a tour. We document these variations where possible and encourage users to verify <strong>matilda actors names</strong> against the programme or official credits for the exact performance they are researching.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Sourcing principle:</strong> We cross-reference all cast information against official credits, theatre programmes, and reputable secondary sources. Where sources conflict, we note the discrepancy and indicate the provenance of each version. Users are encouraged to consult primary sources for definitive confirmation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our update cadence reflects the pace of new productions and casting announcements. We review and update content regularly to incorporate new film releases, major stage productions, and significant casting news. However, we do not attempt to track every performance of every touring production in real time, as this would be impractical and would compromise the accuracy and reliability of the site. Instead, we focus on providing a robust framework and clear guidance on how to verify <strong>matilda theatrical cast</strong> information for specific performances.</p>

<h2>Source standards table</h2>
<p>The table below outlines how different types of sources are weighted in our verification process. This hierarchy guides our editorial decisions and helps users understand the relative reliability of different types of cast information. Whether you are researching <strong>matilda film actors</strong>, <strong>matilda stage cast</strong> members, or <strong>matilda voice actors</strong>, this framework provides a clear path to accurate, well-sourced documentation.</p>

<p>Official credits receive the highest priority because they represent the authoritative record issued by the production company, studio, or theatre. For the 1996 film and the 2022 film adaptation, studio-issued cast lists and end-credit sequences provide definitive documentation of <strong>matilda movie cast members</strong>. For stage productions, theatre programmes are the primary source, as they document the <strong>matilda musical performers</strong> who actually appeared in a specific performance. However, programmes are date-specific and may not reflect casting changes that occur later in a run.</p>
<p>Reference works such as encyclopedias and film archives provide valuable background context and are useful for cross-checking information, but they should not be relied upon as the sole source for <strong>matilda character actors</strong> or <strong>matilda actor roles</strong>. Major news outlets offer contextual support, particularly for casting announcements, interviews, and reviews, but press coverage can sometimes contain errors or reflect preliminary information that changes before opening night. By consulting multiple sources and noting the provenance of each piece of information, users can build a comprehensive and reliable picture of the <strong>matilda production cast</strong> for any given production.</p>
