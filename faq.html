<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
<details open>
<summary>What is the matilda cast?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>The Matilda cast refers to the actors and performers who portray characters in the film, musical, or theatrical adaptation of Roald Dahl. Because there are multiple productions and touring companies, the cast of Matilda can change by year, country, and venue, so credits should be checked against official sources.</p>
<p>The term encompasses <strong>matilda film actors</strong> from the 1996 movie and the 2022 musical film, <strong>matilda musical performers</strong> from stage productions worldwide, and <strong>matilda theatrical cast</strong> members from regional and touring companies. Each production has its own distinct <strong>cast of Matilda</strong>, and the specific performers can vary significantly depending on the format, location, and date of the performance.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Why do matilda movie cast members differ from matilda stage cast listings?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Film credits are fixed once released, while stage and touring productions rotate performers, understudies, and ensemble members. A matilda production cast list may therefore be date-specific, and programmes can differ between cities and international runs.</p>
<p>The 1996 film and the 2022 film adaptation of the musical each have a permanent <strong>matilda cast list</strong> that does not change after release. In contrast, stage productions feature rotating <strong>matilda character actors</strong>, with multiple performers often sharing lead roles, and <strong>matilda ensemble cast</strong> members changing throughout a run. Touring productions add further complexity, as the <strong>matilda stage cast</strong> may be entirely different in London, New York, Sydney, or regional venues, even when performances occur simultaneously.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>How can I confirm matilda character actors for a specific production date?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Start with official credits (film end credits or studio listings) and theatre programmes for the exact performance date. Then cross-check with reputable coverage from major news outlets or established reference sources to reduce errors in matilda actor roles.</p>
<p>For films, consult the end credits and official studio materials, which provide definitive documentation of <strong>matilda film actors</strong>. For stage productions, obtain the theatre programme issued for the specific performance you are researching, as it will list the <strong>matilda musical performers</strong> who actually appeared that evening. Cross-referencing with sources such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matilda_the_Musical" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia's Matilda the Musical page</a> or archives like <a href="https://www.loc.gov/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">the Library of Congress</a> can help verify information and resolve discrepancies.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Does the site cover matilda cast and crew as well as performers?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>Yes. When available, the guide notes key creative credits that influence casting context, such as director, casting director, and production company, while keeping the main focus on matilda film actors and matilda musical performers.</p>
<p>Understanding the <strong>matilda cast and crew</strong> provides important context for how casting decisions were made and how productions evolved. For example, knowing that the Royal Shakespeare Company originated the stage musical helps explain the casting approach for the original West End production. Similarly, noting the director and casting director for the 1996 film sheds light on the selection of <strong>matilda movie cast members</strong>. While our primary focus remains on performers, we include crew information where it enhances understanding of the <strong>matilda production cast</strong>.</p>
</div>
</details>
<details>
<summary>Are matilda voice actors included?</summary>
<div class="details-content">
<p>If a production includes voice performance or dubbing, voice actors may be listed separately from on-screen performers. Voice credits should be verified using official releases and end-credit documentation.</p>
<p>For dubbed versions of the films or any animated adaptations, <strong>matilda voice actors</strong> are documented separately from on-screen talent. Voice credits are sometimes omitted from promotional materials, so it is essential to consult official studio releases and end-credit sequences. When researching <strong>matilda actors names</strong> for voice work, prioritise primary sources and cross-check with reputable references such as <a href="https://www.britannica.com/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Britannica</a> to ensure accuracy.</p>
